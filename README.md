# MetaMask iOS SDK

Import MetaMask SDK into your native iOS dapp to enable your users to easily connect with their
MetaMask Mobile wallet.

See the [example iOS dapp](Example) and the documentation for
[setting up the SDK in your iOS dapp](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/connect/set-up-sdk/mobile/ios/)
for more information.

You can also see the [JavaScript SDK repository](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk) and the
[Android SDK repository](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-android-sdk).

## Prerequisites

- MetaMask Mobile version 7.6.0 or later installed on your target device (that is, a physical device
  or emulator).
  You can install MetaMask Mobile from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202)
  or clone and compile MetaMask Mobile from [source](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile)
  and build to your target device. Deeplink communication is only available from MetaMask Wallet version 7.21.0

- iOS version 15 or later.
  The SDK supports `ios-arm64` (iOS devices) and `ios-arm64-simulator` (M1 chip simulators).
  It currently doesn't support `ios-ax86_64-simulator` (Intel chip simulators).
  
  - Swift 5.5 or later.

## Get started

### 1. Install the SDK

#### CocoaPods

To add the SDK as a CocoaPods dependency to your project, add the following entry to our Podfile:

```text
pod 'metamask-ios-sdk'
```

Run the following command:

```bash
pod install
```

#### Swift Package Manager

To add the SDK as a Swift Package Manager (SPM) package to your project, in Xcode, select
**File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.
Enter the URL of the MetaMask iOS SDK repository: `https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-ios-sdk`.

Alternatively, you can add the URL directly in your project's package file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-ios-sdk",
        from: "0.7.1"
    )
]
```

### 2. Import the SDK

Import the SDK by adding the following line to the top of your project file:

```swift
import metamask_ios_sdk
```

### 3. Connect your dapp

We have provided a convenient way to make rpc requests without having to first make a connect request. Please refer to [Connect With Request](#5-connect-with-request) for examples. Otherwise you can connect your dapp to MetaMask as follows:

Create dapp metadata
```swift
let appMetadata = AppMetadata(name: "Dub Dapp", url: "https://dubdapp.com")
```

#### Option 1: Deeplink Communication Layer
The SDK supports communication with MetaMask wallet via deeplinking. To configure your dapp to work with deeplink communication you need to add a url scheme in your dapp target's Info setting under URL Types. Alternatively you can add it in your dapp's plist as shown below:
```
    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
            <string>Editor</string>
            <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
            <string>com.dubdapp</string>
            <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
            <array>
                <string>dubdapp</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </array>
```
Then in the AppDelegate's open url method handle deeplinks from the MetaMask wallet
```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    if URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true)?.host == "mmsdk" {
        MetaMaskSDK.sharedInstance?.handleUrl(url)
    } else {
        // handle other deeplinks
    }
    return true
}
```
And then initialise the SDK, specifying `.deeplinking` as the transport type, passing the dapp's' scheme you added in the URL Types as the `dappScheme`.
```swift
@ObservedObject var metamaskSDK = MetaMaskSDK.shared(
    appMetadata,
    transport: .deeplinking(dappScheme: "dubdapp"),
    sdkOptions: SDKOptions(infuraAPIKey: "your-api-key") // for read-only RPC calls
)
```
#### NOTE
Note that deeplink communication is only available from MetaMask Wallet version 7.21.0.

#### Option 2: Socket Communication Layer
Alternatively, by default, the dapp communicates with the MetaMask wallet via sockets.
```swift
// To use deeplinking as transport layer
@ObservedObject var metamaskSDK = MetaMaskSDK.shared(
    appMetadata,
    transport: .socket,
    sdkOptions: SDKOptions(infuraAPIKey: "your-api-key") // for read-only RPC calls
```
Then connect the SDK
```swift
let connectResult = await metamaskSDK.connect()
```

By default, MetaMask logs three SDK events: `connectionRequest`, `connected`, and `disconnected`.
This allows MetaMask to monitor any SDK connection issues.
To disable this, set `metamaskSDK.enableDebug = false`.

### 4. Call methods

You can now call any [JSON-RPC API method](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/eth_subscribe/)
using `metamaskSDK.request()`.

We have provided convenience methods for most common rpc calls so that you do not have to manually construct rpc requests. However, if you wish to provide a more fine-grained request not catered for by the convenience methods you can construct a request and then call `metamaskSDK.request(EthereumRequest)`

#### Example: Get chain ID

The following example gets the user's chain ID by calling
[`eth_chainId`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/eth_chainid/).

```swift
let result = await metamaskSDK.getChainId()
```

#### Example: Get account balance

The following example gets the user's account balance by calling
[`eth_getBalance`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/eth_getbalance/).

```swift

// Create parameters
let selectedAddress = metamaskSDK.account

// Make request
let accountBalance = await metamaskSDK.getEthBalance(address: selectedAddress, block: "latest")
```

#### Example: Send transaction

The following example sends a transaction by calling
[`eth_sendTransaction`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/eth_sendtransaction/).

**Use convenience method**
```swift
let selectedAddress = metamaskSDK.account

let result = await metamaskSDK.sendTransaction(
    from: selectedAddress, 
    to: "0x...", // recipient address
    value: "0x....." // amount
    )
```

**Use a dictionary**

If your request parameters make up a simple dictionary of string key-value pairs, you can use the
dictionary directly.
Note that `Any` or even `AnyHashable` types aren't supported, since the type must be explicitly known.

```swift
// Create parameters
let account = metamaskSDK.account

let parameters: [String: String] = [
    "to": "0x...", // receiver address
    "from": account, // sender address
    "value": "0x..." // amount
  ]

// Create request
let transactionRequest = EthereumRequest(
    method: .ethSendTransaction,
    params: [parameters] // eth_sendTransaction expects an array parameters object
    )

// Make a transaction request
let transactionResult = await metamaskSDK.request(transactionRequest)
```

**Use a struct**

For more complex parameter representations, define and use a struct that conforms to `CodableData`,
that is, a struct that implements the following requirement:

```
func socketRepresentation() -> NetworkData
```

The type can then be represented as a socket packet.

```swift
struct Transaction: CodableData {
    let to: String
    let from: String
    let value: String
    let data: String?

    init(to: String, from: String, value: String, data: String? = nil) {
        self.to = to
        self.from = from
        self.value = value
        self.data = data
    }

    func socketRepresentation() -> NetworkData {
        [
            "to": to,
            "from": from,
            "value": value,
            "data": data
        ]
    }
}

// Create parameters
let account = metamaskSDK.account

let transaction = Transaction(
    to: "0x...", // receiver address
    from: account, // sender address
    value: "0x..." // amount
)

// Create request
let transactionRequest = EthereumRequest(
    method: .ethSendTransaction,
    params: [transaction] // eth_sendTransaction expects an array parameters object
    )

// Make a transaction request
let result = await metamaskSDK.request(transactionRequest)
```
#### Example: Send chained rpc (batch) requests
```swift

Please note that for request batching, the collection of `EthereumRequest<T>` needs to be of the same `<T>` type, i.e all requests use the same `params` type, e.g `[Transaction]`, or `[String]` etc. You can mix the rpc requests e.g a mix of `personal_sign`, eth_signTypedData_v4 etc as long as they share the same params type. 
// Create parameters
let account = metamaskSDK.account

let params1: [String] = [account, "Message 1"]
let params2: [String] = [account, "Message 2"]
let params3: [String] = [account, "Message 3"]

let signRequest1 = EthereumRequest(
    method: .personalSign,
    params: params1
)

let signRequest2 = EthereumRequest(
    method: .personalSign,
    params: params2
)

let signRequest3 = EthereumRequest(
    method: .personalSign,
    params: params3
)

let requestBatch: [EthereumRequest] = [signRequest1, signRequest2, signRequest3]

let result = await metamaskSDK.batchRequest(requestBatch)
```

### 5. Connect With Request
#### Example: Connect with request

We have provided a convenience method that enables you to connect and make any request in one rpc request without having to call `connect()` first.

```swift
let transaction = Transaction(
    to: to,
    from: metamaskSDK.account, // this is initially empty before connection, will be populated with selected address once connected
    value: amount
)

let parameters: [Transaction] = [transaction]

let transactionRequest = EthereumRequest(
    method: .ethSendTransaction,
    params: parameters
)

let transactionResult = metamaskSDK.connectWith(transactionRequest)
```

#### Example: Connect with sign

We have further provided a specific convenience method that enables you to connect and make a personal sign rpc request.
In this case you do not need to construct a request, you only provide the message to personal sign.

```kotlin
val message = "This is the message to sign"

let connectSignResult = await metamaskSDK.connectAndSign(message: message)

switch connectSignResult {
    case let .success(value):
        // use result
    case let .failure(error):
        // handle error
}
```
